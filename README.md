### Scaling Agile Estimations

Resources: [1], [2]

##### Intro and Context
* Multiple teams working on the same code base
* Tens of developers, business and operations people

##### SAFe
* Assign 8 points for every developer/tester in the team

##### LeSS
* Have a estimation workshop with all the team (or reprezentatives)
* Give it a few iterations to stabilize

##### Scaling Conclusions
* One backlog
* One Definition of Done
* Rotate team memembers between teams to share knowledge and uderstanding

## The Future
Criticism Of Estimations and the `#NoEstimates` Movement

* No matter how hard we try,
* No matter how many techniques we employ,
* No matter what tips we use,
* History and Statistics tell us that we will fail at having a reliable estimation

Don't focus on estimating on what can be delivered, but rather deliver what can not be estimated. 

It sounds daunting, but there is hope.
#NoEstimates! Let us take a brief look at what the promoters of #NoEstimates are saying
